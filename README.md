**Solvers Club** is a community of people who share an interest in solving problems through participating in challenges and competitions which require a combination of human ingenuity and technological expertise.

We help our members form teams and provide them with resources to help them improve their performance in the competitions they choose to participate in. 

We do not organize the challenges themselves, we participate in them.

Anyone can join the Solvers Club, whatever their level of technical expertise, professional experience or education. All you need is to be prepared to make an honest commitment with yourself and the rest of the Club members, and to have a [lusory attitude](https://www.universityxp.com/blog/2020/7/30/what-is-the-lusory-attitude).

We participate in all kinds of challenges and competitions. The only condition for Solvers Club to provide resources to teams participating in a particular challenge is that the competition is fair, has a clear purpose, and the goals are realistically achievable.

The Solvers Club is divided in six different **Sections**:

 **Artificial Intelligence**

**Blockchain**

**Engineering**

**Cybersecurity**

**Robotics**

**Biotechnology**

Each of these Sections has its own dedicated resources, depending on the needs of the members and on the competitive landscape of each one of them. For example, members of the Artificial Intelligence Section have access to cloud computing resources on which to train their models, while Engineering teams may access specialized information sources or subject matter experts to assist them.
